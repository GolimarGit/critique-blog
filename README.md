# critique-blog

This repository contains files related to a sort of blog post website where the author (Golimar) writes down his thoughts on subjects that interest him, typically critiques of video games or pieces of media he has consumed.
Inspired by friends who push me to be a better version of myself.

# Technologies
Uses Jekyll to [generate](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) a static website using the Bundler tool.
Initial hosting [issue](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/newbie-problems-with-wdm-errors/9233) related to the installation of wdm which was later resolved after commenting out a single line from one of the files in the `Jekyll` directory.
